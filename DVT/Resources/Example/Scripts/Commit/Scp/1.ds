# Example DVT Dicom Script

##
## SCP Storage Commitment DICOMScript: 1.ds
##
## Pre-conditions:
##      - no association
##
## Test Scenario:
##      - expect association for Storage Commitment Push - Service Class
##              - little endian implicit VR
##      - send accept association - Result/Reason = 0 - success
##	- expect N-ACTION-RQ Storage Commitment Push
##	- send N-ACTION-RSP - status = 0000 (success)
##	- send N-EVENT-REPORT-RQ Storage Commitment Push - Success
##	- expect N-EVENT-REPORT-RSP - status = 0000 (success)
##	- expect association release request
##	- send association release response
##
## Expected Result:
##      - SCU signals Storage Commitment - SUCCESS
##
## Post-conditions:
##      - no association
