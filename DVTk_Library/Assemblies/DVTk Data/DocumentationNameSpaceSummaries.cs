    /// In many cases we might like to extend the collection classes provided by the framework. 
    /// Maybe we need to ensure that only objects of certain types are stored in the collection 
    /// or we need a different sorting algorithm. 
    /// Either way, custom collection classes will de-/serialize properly as long as they 
    /// implement IEnumerable or ICollection and, of course, we supply enough information 
    /// about the types stored inside the collection. Keep in mind that only the items that 
    /// can be accessed through the interfaces are serialized, 
    /// public properties and fields are not, unless they return a class 
    /// that itself implements ICollection. 
    /// There is another caveat when you implement your own container classes: 
    /// The implementation of the XmlSerializer requires the collection to have 
    /// a default accessor, even though ICollection does not require it. 
    /// In VB.Net a default accessor is implemented as an Item property with a single 
    /// parameter of type Integer. In C# it is implemented as an indexer. 
    /// The syntax for an indexer resembles a read-only property, but it uses 
    /// the square brackets around the parameter.

    /// These collection classes are internally used by the component.
