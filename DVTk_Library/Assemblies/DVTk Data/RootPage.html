    <H2>Introduction</H2>
    <P>
        The Dicom Validation ToolKit is a SDK framework to perform DICOM validation
        tests.
    </P>

        <li>
            is a software utility that assists in testing DICOM conformance,
        <li>
            provides an independant measurement of the accuracy of the Product‘s DICOM
            interface according to the DICOM Standard,

            provides an independant measurement of the accuracy of the Product‘s DICOM
            interface according to the Product‘s Conf. Statement,
        <LI>
            can be used as either SCU or SCP with a direct connection to the Product (via
            TCP/IP),
        <LI>
            measures accuracy in terms of syntax and semantic correctness,

    The diagram below shows the functional areas covered by this validation tool.
    It gives a rough impression about the available functionality.

        The DVTK SDK consists of several components. These components are provided in
        the form of .Net assemblies.
    </P>
    <P>
        The DVTK and DvtkData assemblies may be used by any integrating application.
        Examples of integration applications;
        <UL>
            <LI>
                GUI applications
            <LI>
                Test frameworks such as N-Unit
            <LI>
                Script environments (see&nbsp;also&nbsp;DVTK SDK ScriptSupport)
            </LI>
        </UL>
        DVTK provides DICOM connectivity and validation of DICOM connectivity
        with&nbsp;a System Under Test (SUT).
    <P></P>
    <P>
        DICOM and DUL Messages are defined with the classes defined in DvtkData. These
        messages are send and received within DVTK sessions. Results are typically
        safed to XML results output files.

    <P>
        This diagram shows the physical connection between the DVTK hosting system
        (Dicom Validation Tool System) and the System Under Test. These systems are
        connected by means of a TCP/IP. The DICOM communication between these systems
        is subject to the DVTK validation algorithms.
    </P>
    <P>
        With DVTK it is also possible to validate DICOM media files stored on a
        file-system.
