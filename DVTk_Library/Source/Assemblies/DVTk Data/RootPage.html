            <LI>
            can be used as either SCU or SCP with a direct connection to the Product (via 
            TCP/IP),
            <LI>

        The diagram below shows the functional areas covered by this validation tool. 
        It gives a rough impression about the available functionality.

            The DVTK SDK consists of several components. These components are provided in 
            the form of .Net assemblies.
        </P>
        <P>
            The DVTK and DvtkData assemblies may be used by any integrating application. 
            Examples of integration applications;
            <UL>
                <LI>
                GUI applications
                <LI>
                Test frameworks such as N-Unit
                <LI>
                    Script environments (see&nbsp;also&nbsp;DVTK SDK ScriptSupport)
                </LI>
            </UL>
        DVTK provides DICOM connectivity and validation of DICOM connectivity 
        with&nbsp;a System Under Test (SUT).
        <P></P>
        <P>DICOM and DUL Messages are defined with the classes defined in DvtkData. These 
            messages are send and received within DVTK sessions. Results are typically 
            safed to XML results output files.</P>
        <P>The diagram below shows the component view with its relationships.</P>

        <H2>Architectural View Of The Deployment Model</H2>
        <P>This diagram shows the physical connection between the DVTK hosting system 
            (Dicom Validation Tool System) and the System Under Test. These systems are 
            connected by means of a TCP/IP. The DICOM communication between these systems 
            is subject to the DVTK validation algorithms.</P>
        <P>With DVTK it is also possible to validate DICOM media files stored on a 
            file-system.</P>
